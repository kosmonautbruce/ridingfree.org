# A Truth about Errol Morris?

Errol Morris' maddeningly entertaining new film *My Psychedelic Love Story* is a another installment in his 
decades-long examination of his frustration in finding objective, undeniable, capital "**T**" truth. In his vast 
career, encompassing more than a dozen feature-length documentaries, many short films, a glossy Netflix 
mini-series, countless commercials, even a couple books, Morris returns consistently to his key obsession: What 
do we believe to be true and what do our own personal truths say about who we are.

*My Psychedlic Love Story* is a kind of sequel to his 2017 Netflix mini-series *Wormwood*, which also explored 
how pervasive paranoia plagued both the US government and the emergent counterculture during the Cold War. Two 
entities seemingly so at odds with each other, but ironically connected by a hypnotic thread of psychedelic 
drugs and conspiracy theories they shared. *Wormwood* examined how the government's wreckless desire for a mind 
control tool inevitably left behind a wake of destruction, insidious both to its direct victims but also to a 
wide swath of survivors left to their own personal wreckage. *My Psychedelic Love Story* extends the story to 
the hippies who embraced the mind-expanding capabilities of LSD, but who also succumbed to their own forms of 
paranoia (justified as it may have been by law enforcement's overzealous prohibition).

In the early 1972, lost in a bewildering haze of acid trips and government persecution, Timothy Leary and 
socialite gadfly Joanna Harcourt-Smith found adventure on the lam and romantic passion through the bars of 
prison. From an outside perspective, and with forty years distance, the dissolution of their incendiary 
relationship does not surprise, yet it left Harcourt-Smith deeply wounded and profoundly mystified. Leary had 
ostensibly accepted a plea deal from the DEA, providing incriminating evidence against former drug compatriots 
in exchange for early release from jail. But why should that have ended his relationship to Harcourt-Smith? Did 
she no longer fit his new, post-psychedelic life? Or did he blame Joanna for his capture? Or even worse, for his 
own betrayal of his former ideals? 

Decades after Leary's death, and shortly before Harcourt-Smith's, the likelihood of finding the truth of what 
happened to and between the once lovers appears remote. However, the random discovery of audio tapes of Leary's 
in-prison therapy sessions provided Harcourt-Smith a last chance to discover what was in Leary's mind when it 
all went south. But of course even that seemingly blockbuster evidence proves inconclusive.

Yet that ambivalent situation, a person desperate for certainty about an element of their past, yet unavoidably 
prevented from achieving it, is precisely the ontological space in which Morris operates most skillfully. A 
one-time Princeton philosophy graduate student turned private investigator, turned documentary filmmaker, Morris 
is a profound conglomeration of all those vocations, deeply obsessed with the nature of truth, willing to do the 
practical work of gathering evidence, yet also preternaturally gifted in the art of visual storytelling. Morris 
is famously a vocal defender of a concept of objective truth, demonstrated by his willingness to be ejected from 
his PhD program over the issue and then later celebrated for his use of detective investigation to exonerate an 
innocent death row inmate.

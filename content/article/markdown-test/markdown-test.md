# First test of online markdown document creation

It will be a *crucial* determinant of the value of my static Hugo based blog software setup, whether I can in 
fact use it to successfully create new postings via the command line, using Markdown.

[HackMD](https://hackmd.io) may turn out to be a valuable resource, providing a space to create new documents in 
Markdown, but with the advantages of a Word Processor, at least until I learn Markdown more instinctually.

Are images possible? Does Grogu show up?

So far so good.

It is extremely difficult to know with certainty how popular digital comics are, in the broader landscape of the comics market. The major vendors do not release sales figures, nor share much financial data generally, that would show just how much is spent on digital comics (and subscriptions) or what percentage of the market digital comics occupy. In addition, the popularity of pirated digital comics remains unknown, because of the large number of avenues readers can use to illegally access unauthorized digital comics. 
It might, however, be possible to see how the popularity of digital comics changes over time, even if the absolute numbers remain hard to determine. I was curious to see how the pandemic lockdown might affect the consumption of digital comics, particularly as traditional modes of acquiring comics became temporarily difficult if not impossible. In order to feed their comics habit, would readers look for material online? And if so, would they explore unauthorized sources?

To at least get a glimpse at such a possible lockdown affect on comics, I looked at some data from Google Trends. Even a cursory examination suggests there was in fact a clear rise in interest for online pirated content.
